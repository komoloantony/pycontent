# Feedback

I’ve reviewed your code, and most of it appears to be copied from ChatGPT. 

For now, please avoid using ChatGPT to write code. 

To become better at what you do and to truly understand what you’re describing, it’s important that you learn to write the code yourself. 

Please start with an introduction to Python up to Python libraries using the link below.

I would also like to see the work in a new repository with a clear description before tomorrow, the 27th, at 3 PM EAT.
